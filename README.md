House Price Prediction Using Lasso Regression
In this project, I built a house price prediction model using Lasso Regression. The process involved the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing:
Identified and handled missing values (NA) by filling them with appropriate strategies to ensure clean and reliable data.

2.Feature Exploration:
Analyzed the relationships between features and their correlation with house prices using visualizations and graphs to understand their impact.

3.Model Preparation:
Split the data into training and testing sets using a test-train split to validate the model performance.
 
4.Model Training:
Used Lasso Regression to train the model on the training data. This model was selected for its ability to handle feature selection and reduce overfitting.

5.Prediction:
The trained Lasso Regression model was used to predict house prices on the test set, achieving promising results.


This project showcases the importance of data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation in building an effective house price prediction model. The Lasso Regression model provided valuable insights and made reasonably accurate predictions, demonstrating its effectiveness for this type of regression problem.
